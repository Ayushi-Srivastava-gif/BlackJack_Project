**Game Setup**:
1. Number cards are worth their face value.
2. Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10.
3. Aces are worth 1 or 11.

**Gameplay**:
-> Dealing:
Each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards. Playersâ€™ cards are face up; one of the dealer's cards is face up and the other face down.

-> Player's Turn:
Players decide to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). Players can continue to hit until they stand or bust (exceed 21).

-> Dealer's Turn:
The dealer reveals their hidden card and must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher. The dealer must stand on a soft 17 (hand totaling 17 with an Ace valued as 11).

**Winning**:
1. If a player exceeds 21, they bust and lose.
2. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.
3. The closest hand to 21 without busting wins.
4. If the dealer and a player have the same hand value, it is a draw (push).
